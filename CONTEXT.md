# rbchat Domain Glossary

## User
A person using rbchat. Identified by a **Username** and a **Team**. Persisted locally.

## Desktop notifications
Sent via `beeep.Notify` for incoming chat messages from other users. Toggle at runtime with Ctrl+N (updates `Model.notificationsEnabled`). Disable entirely at startup with `--no-notify` flag (skips `Model.notificationsEnabled` initialization). Indicator shown in the title bar: 🔔 (green) when enabled, 🔕 (red) when disabled.

## @mentions
A User is mentioned by including `@<their-username>` in a chat message. On receipt of a non-replay `chat` message from another user whose text mentions the local username, a banner appears on the top line of the terminal reading `🔔 <sender> mentioned you in a message`.

The banner (`Model.mentionBy`) stays up until the User acts: it clears when they send a message or press Esc. A later @mention simply replaces the current one.

### Suggestion picker
Typing `@` in the input opens a picker above the message box (`Model.suggestions`, rendered by `suggestionPopup`). `MentionPrefix` reads the partial mention from the text left of the cursor — requiring `@` to start a word, so `matt@rdbrck` is left alone — and `MatchUsernames` filters against it case-insensitively, capped at `maxSuggestions` (5) and sorted alphabetically.

Candidates come from `onlinePeers`: usernames in `Model.lastSeen` within `peerWindow`, minus the local user. A peer who has not been heard from in the last 60s is not offered, so the list can be empty on a cold start until heartbeats arrive.

The first match is highlighted, so Enter completes rather than sends while the picker is open. ↑/↓ move through the list and wrap; Tab and Enter complete (inserting the username plus a trailing space); Esc closes the picker without touching the typed text. The picker borrows its rows from the viewport (`resizeForSuggestions`) the same way the help panel reserves `helpHeight`, keeping the total render inside the terminal.

Matching (`mentionsUser`) is case-insensitive: each whitespace-separated word is compared to `@<username>` after trimming surrounding punctuation, so `@matt` matches, but `@matthew` and `email@matt` do not. Mentions in the User's own messages and in replayed history are never flashed. The banner is independent of the desktop-notification toggle (Ctrl+N).

## Title bar
Three concatenated lipgloss-styled segments, each independently setting the purple background (#7C3AED), to prevent ANSI-reset gaps from the bell emoji breaking the background color for the peer count.

Segments: `left = "rbchat | {addr} | "`, `middle = bellStyle.Render("🔔"/"🔕")`, followed by the peer count, `? for help` hint, and version. Background color is dark slate `#1A1B26`.

## Username
A display name chosen by the User on first launch. Persisted locally.

## Team
An affiliation or group the User belongs to, selected from a predefined list of team names on first launch. Persisted locally. Displayed as a colored label next to the Username in chat messages. Each team has a distinct color:

| Team | Color |
|------|-------|
| Animoto | Yellow `#FFD700` |
| Delivra | Cyan `#00CED1` |
| Duplex | Orange `#FFA500` |
| Leadpages | Purple `#7C3AED` |
| Paved | Green `#10B981` |
| Shift | Blue `#3B82F6` |
| Redbrick | Red `#EF4444` |

Usernames are rendered in the default terminal color (no foreground override). Team names are rendered in the terminal default color with the team color applied as foreground. No filtering or scoping by team — purely cosmetic.

## Message (wire format)
Unified JSON structure for all wire traffic. The `type` field discriminates:

| type | purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chat` | A user-to-user chat message. Displayed in the viewport. |
| `sync` | Sync request. Sent on startup to request history; peers respond by broadcasting their recent chat messages. Never displayed in the viewport and never appended to m.messages — stored in DB only. |
| `join` | Self-announcement after setup completes. Displayed as a system message. |
| `heartbeat` | Periodic presence signal (every 30s). Never stored in DB, never displayed. Only updates `lastSeen` and recalculates `peerCount`. |

Fields: `type` (discriminator), `username`, `team`, `text`, `timestamp` (ISO 8601), `message_id` (UUID v4), `replay` (bool, omitempty), `signature` (string, omitempty — HMAC-SHA256 hex digest).

## Message signing
Every outgoing message is signed with HMAC-SHA256 using a shared secret (`RBCHAT_SECRET`). The HMAC is computed over `message_id + type + username + team + text + timestamp` (in that order, excluding `replay` and `signature`). The resulting hex digest is set as the `signature` field.

On receipt, the listener recomputes the HMAC and verifies it against the stored signature. Messages with invalid or missing signatures are silently dropped when a secret is configured. Messages loaded from the local DB are also revalidated against the current secret before display or sync replay; a non-empty signature alone is not trusted.

The secret is injected at build time via `-ldflags -X main.rbchatSecret=...` (sourced from `RBCHAT_SECRET` env var in GoReleaser/CI). When no secret is set, signing and verification are disabled entirely — all messages pass through unchanged.

## Replay flag
A transient boolean on the wire format (`Message.Replay`). Set to `true` by `respondToSync()` for history replays. On receipt, suppresses desktop notifications and peer tracking so replaying old messages doesn't trigger alerts or inflate the online count. Never stored in the DB.

## Day dividers
The `refreshViewport()` function inserts a date divider line between messages from different days, rendered in gray (`#6B7280`). Format: `── Jan 2, 2006 ──`. The first day group has no preceding divider. Messages that render as empty (`sync` type) are skipped entirely and don't affect the date tracking.

## Timestamp
ISO 8601 on the wire and in the DB. Displayed in the viewport as `[Mon DD HH:MM]` (e.g. `[Jun 24 14:30]`). Parsed on receipt, formatted for display in `View()`.

## Setup flow (first launch)
Before Bubble Tea starts, use simple `fmt.Print`/`bufio.Scanner` prompts:
1. Prompt for username
2. Show team selection list (numbered), prompt for choice
3. Persist both to config table
4. Proceed to Bubble Tea

## TUI components
- `bubbles/textinput` for the message input bar
- `bubbles/viewport` for the scrollable chat log pane
- `lipgloss` for styling (colors, borders, layout)

## config table
Local SQLite table with columns: `key` (TEXT PK), `value` (TEXT). Stores `username`, `team`, and any future per-user settings.

## messages table
Local SQLite table with columns: `id` (INTEGER PK), `message_id` (TEXT, UNIQUE), `type` (TEXT), `username` (TEXT), `team` (TEXT), `text` (TEXT), `timestamp` (TEXT), `signature` (TEXT, DEFAULT '').

## Model.messages
An in-memory `[]Message` slice. This is the source of truth for what the viewport displays. On startup, seeded from DB (last 50 **chat** messages from today — join/sync filtered out). During runtime, all message types (chat, join) are appended as they arrive in real-time. Capped at 10,000 messages — trims from the front when exceeded. The DB is the full archive; the slice is a rolling window. Sync-type messages are never appended to m.messages (stored in DB only).

## SQL queries (sqlc)
1. `GetConfig(key)` — select value from config
2. `SetConfig(key, value)` — insert or replace into config
3. `InsertMessage(...)` — insert into messages with `ON CONFLICT(message_id) DO NOTHING` for dedup
4. `GetRecentMessagesToday(n)` — select * from messages where date(timestamp) = date('now') order by id desc limit n

## db path
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/rbchat/rbchat.db` — defaults to `~/.local/share/rbchat/rbchat.db`. Directory created on first launch.

## Startup flow
1. Open/create DB. Run schema migrations.
2. Check config for `username`. If missing → run setup (prompt for username, pick team).
3. Start Bubble Tea with a "Syncing with the mesh..." loading view.
4. Broadcast a `sync`-type message.
5. Peers respond by broadcasting their last 50 **chat** messages (from today) — join and sync messages are excluded.
6. Joining peer absorbs them silently — stores in DB, appends to m.messages. No notifications or peer tracking for replays.
7. When sync completes (2s timeout): sort m.messages chronologically by ISO 8601 timestamp string, then transition to the chat view. Viewport shows day dividers between different dates.
8. Broadcast a `join`-type message to announce presence.

## Sync
Entirely multicast-based. A joining peer broadcasts a `sync`-type message. Existing peers respond by broadcasting their last 50 **chat** messages (join/sync filtered out), preserving the original message_id for dedup but marking `Replay: true`. Sync-type messages on the wire are only ever the sync request itself — never appended to m.messages, stored in DB only.

## Event bridge
The network listener goroutine calls `program.Send(IncomingMessage{...})` directly (thread-safe in Bubble Tea) to inject parsed messages into the `Update` loop. No intermediate channel.

## Error display
If a send fails, a red `[Error] Failed to send message` line is rendered briefly in the viewport (held in `Model.err`). Clears automatically on the next successful send.

## Shutdown
Ctrl+C in the Bubble Tea view → display "Shutting down..." → cancel the listener goroutine's context → close UDP connections → close DB → `tea.Quit`.

## Peer tracking

"Peers online" count is the number of unique message senders seen within the last 60 seconds. Every `chat`, `join`, and `heartbeat` message refreshes the sender's 60-second timer — `sync` messages (history replays) are excluded to prevent stale peers from appearing online.

### Heartbeat protocol

Each client broadcasts a `heartbeat`-type message every 30 seconds (`heartbeatInterval`). The heartbeat has no special content beyond the standard message fields — `Text` is set to `"heartbeat"` to satisfy the broadcaster's non-empty check. On receipt, the listener:

1. Rejects heartbeats during sync (would inflate count while replaying)
2. Stores the sender's username and team in `Model.lastSeen` alongside the current timestamp
3. Recalculates `m.peerCount` via `countActivePeers()`

Heartbeats are never persisted to the database and never appended to `m.messages`. They exist solely to keep the timestamp fresh for the 60-second sliding window. A user who closes the app stops heartbeating and falls off the list within 30–60 seconds.

### Online users list

Pressing `ctrl+t` toggles `Model.showUserList`. When active, `View()` replaces the viewport content with an alphabetically sorted list of active peers (username + team) via `SetContent`. New messages continue to accumulate in `m.messages` while the list is shown but don't overwrite the viewport. Pressing `ctrl+t` again restores the chat view via `refreshViewport()`.

## Network scoping (network_id)
Messages are scoped to the physical LAN to prevent cross-contamination between different networks (e.g. office vs home). Each message is tagged with a `network_id` derived from the **default gateway's MAC address**, which is unique per physical router.

Detection: `ComputeNetworkID()` finds the gateway IP via `route -n get default` (macOS), `/proc/net/route` (Linux), or `route print` (Windows), then resolves its MAC via `arp -n <gw>` (macOS/Linux) or `arp -a <gw>` (Windows). The MAC is hashed with SHA-256 (first 8 bytes → 16-char hex). If detection fails (no network, unsupported OS), `network_id` is left empty and messages are untagged.

The `Message.NetworkID` field is set on all outgoing messages (chat, join, sync). On receipt, messages with a mismatched non-empty `network_id` are silently dropped. When loading messages from the local DB, only messages matching the current `network_id` are loaded (or all if `network_id` is empty). The `messages` table has a `network_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` column; existing messages default to empty (backwards compatible).
